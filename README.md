# cpp-project-template

Modern project C++20 project template that uses CMake, Google Test, and vcpkg.

### Why use this?

- There are much more thorough and more popular project templates out there. There's actually very little reason for _you_ to use this, unless your needs are similar to mine. This template doesn't really try to be everything to everyone, it fits my use case, and doesn't contain a lot of stuff I don't need.

### Why use vcpkg?

There are a number of pros to vcpkg:

- We get an actual package manager
    - We don't need to use git submodules, CMake FetchContent, copy code into our repo, use a system package manager (usually), etc.
- We get slightly more reproducible builds, which is great.

## Requirements

- CMake â‰¥ 3.21
- Ninja (at least by default, other build presets can be configured)
- C++20
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)

## Usage

This project assumes you already have [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) installed - by cloning it somewhere, running the bootstrap script, and set the `VCPKG_ROOT` envrionment variable.

### Building

Release builds (using Ninja) can be created using:

```bash
cmake --preset=release
cmake --build --preset=release
```

Debug builds (also with Ninja) can made with:

```bash
cmake --preset=debug
cmake --build --preset=debug
```

To do a fresh configure:

```bash
cmake --preset=release --fresh
```

Or to wipe away a build:

```bash
cmake --build --preset=release --target clean
```
